# mathematica-practical-programs
A repository of all the programs I have created using mathematica for solving little interesting problems.

Everytime that I think of a curious of interesting problem I have to solve it. 
From generating word echos, to converting a word to its equivalent with element names, to playing with images,
everything will be uploaded here.

Each folder will contain the code and probably one or two examples of what the code can do.
